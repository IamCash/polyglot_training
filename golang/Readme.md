Golang, also known as Go, is an open-source programming language that's used for a variety of purposes: Web development, Cloud services, Server management, Command-line interfaces etc. 

The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive.

Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language.

Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. 

Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines.
